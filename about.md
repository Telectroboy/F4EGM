## Transceivers

- **YAESU FT-991** – Base station (QTH)
- **TYT UV390 GPS** – DMR + APRS handheld (stock antenna)
- **TYT MD-9600 OpenGD77** – Mobile DMR (Diamond SG7900 + DIY GPS) — now for sale
- **HONGKAIDE DM9100** – Repaired and now operational on the desk  

  Knowledge database (in progress):  
  https://github.com/Telectroboy/HongKaide-DM9100-Knowledge-Database

- **QRP Labs QMX+** + ATU-100 – QRP / WSPR beacon  
  Nice and easy kit to build.

- **Anytone AT-D578UV Plus (VHF/UHF/DMR/GPS/AirBand)**  
  Bought defective — VHF PA (NXP AFT05MP075N) was dead.  
  Now delivering solid 50 W.

- **2× UV-K5** – Local use (CEC HF board + custom firmware)
- **Baofeng TK11(8)**

Special thanks to **F4EPR** for my very first HF QSO — and first CW contact.

First CW calls made with only 5 W, then 10 W.

## HF Antennas

**EFHW – 40 m wire @ 4 m height**

- 49:1 balun using two stacked FT240-43 Fair-Rite cores
- Planning tests with 2643251002 Fair-Rite ferrite for improvement

**Second EFHW – 20 m wire for QRP (QMX+)**

## Satellite Antenna

Bi-band VHF/UHF tape-measure Yagi (no duplexer).  
3D printable adaptable parts available (OnShape).

Original design:  
https://www.qsl.net/dk7zb/Duoband/duoband_2-70_2-3.htm

Modified for tape-measure elements by F4EGM.

### Dimensions

- VHF reflector: 102.3 cm (position 0)
- UHF reflector: 32 cm (23 cm from VHF reflector, center-to-center)
- VHF radiator: 94.6 cm (including 9 mm gap), 37.2 cm spacing

## About Me

I built my first CW keyer at age 10 using wood and a Polaroid cassette spring.  
Powered by a 4.5 V battery and two light bulbs, messages were exchanged under a door with my brother.

At 15, I discovered radio via CB (27 MHz).  
Since then, radio has never left me.

Active since 1997 on 11 m band.  
Early digital modes (SSTV, Packet, PSK31 from 1998).

Former treasurer (10 years) of Sierra-Alpha DX Group.  
Now member of:

- F4KJP Radioclub  
- ADRASEC08 → https://adrasec08.fr/

Professionally:

- Electronics Engineer (R&D)
- DevOps / SysOp / Full-Stack / Data & Security manager

Currently working on:

- Railway antenna experimentation
- MARCONI H2550 digital radio repairs
- Custom modular diagnostic test benches

Languages:  
French, English (fluent)
